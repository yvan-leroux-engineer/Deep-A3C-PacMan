## Context
This project serves as a practical application of the knowledge acquired from the RCP 211 module, "Advanced Artificial Intelligence." The chosen case study revolves around implementing a Deep A3C agent for playing Pac-Man using the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic technique introduced by a Google research team in 2016.

## Objectives
- Implement a Deep A3C agent for playing Pac-Man.
- Understand the advantages of asynchronous training.
- Analyze the demonstrated results of the technique.
- Set up the working environment for implementation.

## Paper Synthesis
This section provides a synthesis of the relevant paper, focusing on:
- Advantages of the asynchronous training approach.
- Demonstrated results highlighting the effectiveness of the technique.
- Overview of the A3C method.

## Environment Setup
The project involves preparing the working environment, including:
- Setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
- Installing the required gym[all] library.
- Additional tools necessary for the implementation.

## Network Implementation
This section covers the details of implementing the Deep A3C network:
- General structure of the network.
- Functionality of the classes and functions.
- In-depth details and parameters of the classes and functions.

## Results
An analysis of the results achieved with different models:
- Evaluation of the first model.
- Insights from the second model.
- Performance of the third model.
- Overall summary and assessment.

## Conclusions
The project concludes with a summary of findings from the implemented agent and the insights derived from the analysis. It reflects on the achieved objectives and potential directions for further improvements.
